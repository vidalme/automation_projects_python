<h4>As a DevOps junior using Python for automation in a shop, you'll likely encounter a 
variety of tasks centered around 
streamlining workflows and improving efficiency. </h4>
<p>Here are some common areas where your Python skills will be valuable:

<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>Infrastructure Provisioning and Management:</h3>
<p><b>Script deployments:</b> Writing Python scripts to automate deployments of your application code to various environments (development, staging, production) on platforms like cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
<p><b>Server provisioning:</b> Creating scripts to automatically set up new servers or infrastructure components with the desired configuration using tools like Terraform or cloud APIs. 

<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>Configuration Management</h3>
<p><b>Automating configuration management:</b> Using Python scripts to manage configuration files for servers, applications, or network devices using tools like Ansible or Chef. This could involve tasks like applying security policies or updating software versions consistently across environments.<br>

<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</h3>
<p><b>Automating build and test processes: </b>Writing scripts to automate building your application code, running unit tests and integration tests, and potentially deploying the code upon successful builds using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
Monitoring and Alerting:

<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>Developing monitoring scripts</h3>
<p>Creating Python scripts to monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, disk space) or application health checks. These scripts could trigger alerts via email, SMS, or communication platforms like Slack if issues arise.

<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>Data Processing and Analysis</h3>
<p>Automating data pipelines: Writing Python scripts to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. This could involve tasks like moving data from databases to data warehouses or performing data analysis for reporting purposes.

<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>Other Potential Tasks:</h3>

<p><b>Automating code reviews:</b> Utilizing Python scripts to automate some aspects of code review processes, such as running static code analysis tools to identify potential bugs or formatting issues.

<p><b>Automating security testing:</b> Integrating Python scripts with security testing frameworks to automate vulnerability scans and generate reports.


<h3 style='font-size:1.5rem;color:orange'>General Skills and Tools:</h3>

In addition to Python scripting, you'll likely encounter other tools and concepts in your DevOps role:
Version control systems like Git
Cloud platform knowledge (AWS, GCP, Azure)
Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools
Understanding of Linux operating systems
Remember, the specific tasks you'll handle will depend on the shop's size, technology stack, and project requirements. But these examples provide a good starting point for what a DevOps junior using Python for automation might encounter.
